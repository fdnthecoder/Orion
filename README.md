# Game API Server

## Setup instructions

You need to have `make` installed. In general, things a developer will want to
do (besides writing code!) will correspond to a `make` target.

- To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.
- To run the server locally, use `source/local.sh`
- To build production, type `make prod`.

## Requirements

The requirements for our Game API server are:

- The user can sign up.
- The user can create a new game.
- The user can list all games.
- The user can join a game.
